# ScaDyG: A New Paradigm for Large-scale Dynamic Graph Learning

This repository is the PyTorch implementation of ScaDyG.

## Requirements
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run
You can run the ScaDyG with the following commands:

python scalable_tgn_main_link_prediction.py --dataset mooc








We provide the mooc dataset as an example.

The raw data set can be downloaded from https://tgb.complexdatalab.com/ for node affinity prediction, and  https://zenodo.org/records/7008205#.Yv_a_3bMJPZ for dynamic link prediction.
